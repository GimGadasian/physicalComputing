class3
switch - open and close the circuit / different pair of wire connected

wire)
dot -> connected wires
dot x, crossed -> not connected wires

switch)
pushbutton: default - not connected
toggle switch: default - connected

homework)
circuit design using 555 switch using bread board(but practice first with circuit)

ac/dc)

dc: voltage rate stable over time
ac: votage rate changes over time

Ohm's law(V = IR)
current flow v water flaw:
	pump : battery
	water pressure(distance between two water height levels) : voltage
	water flow : current flow
	cylinder narrow : resistance
which means, battery keeps voltage level different -> keeps current flow

	I = V / R
	tip) see carefully to the units since sometimes it gives mV, mA etc.. / ex) 1 mega Ohm = 1000 kilo-Ohm = 1,000,000 Ohm

	I = I1 + I2 + I3
